## General Information
- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.
- The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market.
- The company management wants:
   - to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to  invest in them or not.
   - to know which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
   - to know how well those variables describe the price of a house.
- The time series data is provided in the CSV file format.


## Conclusions
- The overall condition of the house being 'Very Excellent', 'Excellent' & 'Very Good' contributes majorly for the house price.
- The location houses at the location 'North ridge' also contributes majorly for the house price.
- '3 Full Bathrooms' above Grade contributes significantly for the house price.
- The 'garage having 3 car capacity' also contributes significantly for the house price.
- The 'Basement with Good Exposure' to walkout or garden level walls also contributes significantly for the house price.
